# Blockstack Indexer

The resolver runs through all the names in the blockstack network, pulls their zonefiles and resolves their profiles by fetching the data there. It persists this data in a mongodb instance to survive restarts and resyncs the data if the process dies.

The blockstack api runs an instance of the resolver to help manage responses. The resolver also has the database connection.
